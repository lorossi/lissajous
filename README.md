# Lissajous curve
Generating lissajous curves in Processing

## What?
Lissajous curves are a particular set of graphs generated by the parametric formula `x = A cos(ax), y = B sin(ax)`. This already looks boring.
Look, I am as bored as you. I mean who even likes math?? *(I do, but that's not for today).*
Formulas are lame, but sometimes they are special and generate really interesting outcomes, if you know how to produce them. Luckily, this is one of those instances.

## How to run the code
Clone the repository on your pc and open it with Processing. It's as easy as that.

### Settings
All the variables inside the file named `settings.pde` can be changed by the final user (you). Feel free to edit them and to experiment a little bit with the final product.
Next to each variable there's a comment describing what it does.

### Commands
I programmed the code with a few shortcuts:
1. Press *left* and *right arrow keys* to change the animation duration
2. Press *up* and *down arrow keys* to change the initial angle
3. Press *E* to record the animation - the output frames will be saved in folder called *frames*
4. Press *Q* to toggle between black and white and colors
5. Press *W* to display the current *frames per second* on the screen
6. Press *R* to change the *rotation direction* (clockwise or anti-clockwise)
7. *Click* on the window to reset the animation

## Output
This is what you will see when you run the code:
